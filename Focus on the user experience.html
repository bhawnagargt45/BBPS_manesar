<p><Font color="red"><font size="6">For sure, work will become more fun and those repetitive activities in our day-to-day life will be done by robots and artificial intelligence.

User experience design (UX) will be more important than other technical components of a project to ensure its success with customers. Skills in solving problems and serving customers will continue to be competitive advantages for the work of the future.
